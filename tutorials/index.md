## Where to Begin

This site contains all of the handouts and information presented in BYU's Fall 2016 Neuroimaging Analysis course. Go to the <a href="https://marylou.byu.edu/account/create/">SuperComputing Account Request page</a>. I've whitelisted the course, so you should be able to get access to the SuperComputer immediately. You will need to have access to the SuperComputer for our first lecture. Happy coding!

### Beginner Topics
