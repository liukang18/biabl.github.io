## Random Field Theory (RFT)
While putting together my lab notebook I realized that it wasn't a great place for providing updates on some of my progress that others might be interested in. So I created a doc that summarizes some of my progress. Hopefully this will lead to a full guide at some point. For now it's just a place to keep track of the project.
