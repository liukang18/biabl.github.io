There's been some recent programs that I've become aware of and that may be useful in lab:

## SURF ICE

Surf Ice is a tool for surface rendering the cortex with overlays to illustrate tractography, network connections, anatomical atlases and statistical maps. While there are many alternatives, Surf Ice is easy to use and uses advances shaders to generate stunning images. This program works well with FreeSurfer and SPM results.

## MINDBOGGLE

The Mindboggle software package automates shape analysis of anatomical labels and features extracted from human brain MR image data. Mindboggle can be run as a single command, and can be installed as a cross-platform virtual machine for convenience and reproducibility of results. Behind the scenes, open source Python and C++ code run within a modular Nipype pipeline framework.
