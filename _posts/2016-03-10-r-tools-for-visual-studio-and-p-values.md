## RTVS

This is just a friendly pointer to some really cool new features now available to Microsot's visual studios. You can find a quick summary of the info by checking out [this](http://www.r-bloggers.com/r-tools-for-visual-studio-preview-now-available/) blog post. Basically, Windows has finally decided to pull their heads out of their...hard drives and support open source programming. The contributions are far from trivial and are actually very exciting because in addition to the many optimizations they have created they have ensured all the CRAN library works with it. So less windows compatability issues...yay!

## P-values
The american statistical association (ASA) has decided it hates p-values. I thought this might be of general interest to us as we proceed in our evaluations. Nature has a nice little article on it [here](http://www.nature.com/news/statisticians-issue-warning-over-misuse-of-p-values-1.19503).
